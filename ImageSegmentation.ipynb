To re-iterate, our model does not care about what the value of the segment ID is for any given segment, what will dictate if our model is working if it can properly distinguish two **distinct** segments. Thus given an outputted segmentation map, any same segmentation map but with the segment IDs permutted is equally valid. Moreover, our model (in theory) should be invariant to more than permutation, that is any value can be assigned to a segment, as long as distinct segments have distinct IDs.\n",

This suggests the use of a recurrent architecture but once again, the order in which the segments would be generated is not of importance. In general, dealing with a variable number of possible segments must be accounted for in the model!"
